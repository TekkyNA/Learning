Learning
========

This is a repository I will be making while I learn to code. Nothing serious will be built here as I will be following tutorials through school and posting them here. I hope to learn much from school and the community based on my coding.
There probably will be nothing special here except the progress I will be making and therefore I could care less if anyone chose
to take my code. Most of it will be code based off of things I learn and not so much original ideas but ideas based off of learning
experiences. Feel free to comment on it or what ever for advice. Andy unneed comments will be deleted.
Thank you.
